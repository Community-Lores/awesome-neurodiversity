# Maintainer handbook + list of maintainers

We also document things at <https://github.com/awesome-neurodiversity/maintainers>, but here's the bare bones:

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a Project Maintainer, you must:

* Help maintain the Awesome Neurodiversity GitHub repository (and its official mirrors), its online presence (through Linktree and socials) and moderate community discussions.
* Review neurodiversity resource suggestions against the Community Code of Conduct and for any possible issues.
* Collaborate with the wider neurodivergent community, both online and in real life, to compile, build and share resources for and by neurodivergent people.
* Work transparently in the public (only go in private when issues arise or when discussing senstive stuff).

To ensure safety and security, we require two-factor authentication to newly-onboarded maintainers and setup their account at [Recap Time Squad's Vaultwarden instance](https://vault.recaptime.eu.org) (since we store most of the passwords and other secrets related to the project).

## Current

* [Andrei Jiroh Halili](https://andreijiroh.eu.org) (he/they) ([`@ajhalili2006`](https://sr.ht/~ajhalili2006)) - Autistic Filipino student mostly, open-source maintainer and web developer at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.eu.org) at night and in free time. Founded the Awesome Neurodiversity project as part of a school project in their Science class.

## Former

Nothing to see here, for now.

## Contacting the maintainers

You can contact all the current maintainers at the following contact menthods:

* **via GitHub**: <https://github.com/awesome-neurodiversity/maintainers/issues/new/choose>

You can also contact individual maintainers personally for things like directly reporting community policy violations, press inquiries and, although please respect their boundaries and space.

## How to join the maintainership team

Simply just [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [be nice](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You don't have to be neurodivergent to help us maintain the project, but you must be open-minded about our lived experiences, aware of disability rights movement and the issues we face every day, and respect for everyone's intersectional identities.

If you're ready, just [reach the maintainers](#contacting-the-maintainers). We know maintaining the project can have a toll on your mental health, so let anybody know if you need extended break.
